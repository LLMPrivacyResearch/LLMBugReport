We are conducting research to examine your ability to decompose bug descriptions from bug reports. 
A bug report from the Apache Jira issue tracker may be too complex to be resolved all at once. 
A better approach could be to decompose the bug descriptions into several smaller, isolated bugs to assist with bug fixing. 
The bug decomposition process should not involve the summarization of code or logs, which should be kept as they are. 
After bug decomposition, each bug should be marked with the prefix "B: ". Each bug should be solvable independently without referring to other bugs. 
Please don't add any extra text or information to the decomposed bugs.
Next, we will provide a bug description below the dashed line. Please decompose it according to the instructions above.
